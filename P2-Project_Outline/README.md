### Overview
MainStage Gaming is an exciting website I am develop to give the consumer live updates of ESports tournaments. At any point in during the tournament, the user will be able to search for different players and see their tournament statistics, placement, and money earned. This is a very important application because there's no website like this yet, and it will make it way more convenient for users to get live updates if they can't watch the tournament. This idea came to me when I was playing in all of the Fortnite World Cup qualifiers, and I was having difficulty seeing my placement and see the points I need to qualify for the world cup (which I didn't qualify).
### Features
The features for this will include pulling from the Fortnite API and displaying player statistics, live tournament updates and being able to search for any user's stats who has ever played fortnite. I will also encorporate if your favorite streamer
